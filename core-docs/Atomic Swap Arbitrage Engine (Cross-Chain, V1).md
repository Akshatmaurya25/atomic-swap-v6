# Atomic Swap Arbitrage Engine (Cross-Chain, V1)

### TL;DR

The Atomic Swap Arbitrage Engine (Cross-Chain, V1) enables real-time, automated arbitrage between digital assets across multiple blockchains by leveraging atomic swap protocols. The engine solves the problem of fragmented liquidity and price inefficiencies between chains, offering risk-minimized, trustless transactions and maximizing trading opportunities. Its primary audience is active traders, crypto funds, and market makers seeking to capture cross-chain arbitrage in a fast, secure, and scalable manner.

### Persona 3: Seasonal Crypto Investor

* As a seasonal investor, I want to receive notifications about rare, high-value arbitrage opportunities, so that I don’t have to monitor the market constantly.

* As a seasonal investor, I want reassurance that trades will not be executed if profit after fees/price slippage falls below a threshold, so that I avoid unexpected losses.

### Persona 4: System Administrator

* As a system admin, I want to monitor live engine health status, so that I can troubleshoot issues proactively.

* As a system admin, I want logs and alerts for failed or reverted swaps, so that I can quickly resolve operational bottlenecks.

## User Experience

*Entry Point & First-Time User Experience*

* Users discover the engine via the API documentation portal or partner platform integration.

* First-time system admins access a secure dashboard to configure API keys, select supported chains, and input wallet addresses.

* Onboarding checklist with brief interactive guide for system setup (API or CLI-based), including security best practices.

*Core Experience*

* *Step 1:* User (or system) configures arbitrage parameters (chains, thresholds, limits) via secure API or admin UI.

  * Simple, clear parameter forms or endpoints.

  * Input validation to prevent mis-configuration.

  * Save/confirm setup and get “engine ready” status.

* *Step 2:* Engine continuously scans cross-chain DEX prices and liquidity for arbitrage conditions.

  * All monitoring/passive; no user intervention unless an actionable opportunity is detected.

* *Step 3:* On triggered opportunity, engine simulates atomic swap with all current fee/latency values.

  * Fast simulation and profit/fee breakdown.

  * Rejects if below min-profit threshold.

* *Step 4:* Atomic swap contract executed; both legs of the swap submitted and confirmed on-chain.

  * Logged outcomes and error codes (if any).

  * Recovery retry logic if a leg fails in submission window.

* *Step 5:* User/system receives notification or may poll API for latest swap results.

  * Full trade data: chain, tokens, time, profit/loss, fees, txIDs.

* *Step 6:* Performance dashboard (for admin or advanced user) visualizes cumulative trades, success rates, realized PnL, and error stats.

*Advanced Features & Edge Cases*

* Power-user option to throttle trades by on-chain congestion indicators.

* Manual override for blacklisting specific DEXes or tokens.

* Automatic pausing and admin alerting after consecutive failed swaps or mispriced oracles.

* Full audit log download for compliance or analysis.

*UI/UX Highlights*

* Accessible API design with comprehensive docs, sample calls, and error codes.

* Simple, responsive admin UI for configuration and monitoring.

* Color-coded status indicators for active, paused, error, and success states.

* WCAG-compliant for visual accessibility.

* Downloadable CSV or JSON logs for user data access.

## Narrative

Janet, a professional crypto trader, has been manually watching multiple DEXes for price differences between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Her main challenge: by the time she identifies and bridges assets to capture the arbitrage profit, the window closes—or the price moves and leaves her exposed to loss or failed settlement. Setting up manual bots has proven unreliable, with risks of bridge failures, race conditions, and high network congestion.

With Atomic Swap Arbitrage Engine (Cross-Chain, V1), Janet configures her strategy in a dedicated dashboard, sets her limits and minimum desired profit per trade, and enables real-time monitoring. The engine automatically scans prices, triggers arbitrage swaps only when net profit (after fees and latency) meets her criteria, and ensures settlement is atomic—no more partial fills or exposure to failed transfers. Trade data and notifications let her track success, and Janet can focus on higher-level strategy.

As a result, Janet captures significantly more winning trades and can scale her operation across chains without worrying about underlying execution risk. For the business, heightened trade throughput and low error rates build confidence, deepen liquidity integrations, and prove product-market fit for expanding support to further chains and enterprise trading partners.
