## User Experience

*Entry Point & First-Time User Experience*

* Users land on the Atomic Swap landing page via direct link or platform navigation.

* A brief intro modal or tooltip outlines swap basics and risk warnings.

* On first visit, an interactive onboarding highlights UI elements and required permissions (e.g., wallet connect).

*Core Experience*

* *Step 1:* User connects their crypto wallet.

  * UI prioritizes prominent, well-supported wallet options.

  * Validates successful wallet connection before activation of swap inputs.

  * Alerts user if wallet connection fails or is incompatible.

* *Step 2:* User selects source/destination chains and tokens, then inputs amount.

  * Only supported token pairs/amounts are selectable; disables ineligible options.

  * Live conversion rates and fee estimates appear in real-time.

  * Enables a “Review Swap” button after all fields validate.

* *Step 3:* User reviews swap summary and confirms.

  * Displays all fees, estimated time, and transaction hashes.

  * Requires user acknowledgement for risk notice (where applicable).

  * “Confirm” triggers transaction submission; UI becomes read-only with loading state.

* *Step 4:* Transaction processing and status updates.

  * UI shows progress indicator (pending, confirming, complete, error).

  * On success: celebrates user; link to transaction explorer.

  * On failure: clear explanation, recovery actions, access to support/help.

* *Step 5:* User can repeat or return to dashboard.

*Advanced Features & Edge Cases*

* Power users can access raw transaction data or advanced swap settings (hidden in MVP, for V2+).

* Handles disconnect/reconnect events; robust retry flows for intermittent network failure.

* Surfaces precise reasons and user actions for edge-case failures (e.g., exceeded gas, invalid nonce).

*UI/UX Highlights*

* High color contrast and readable fonts for accessibility.

* Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.

* Error messages are never technical; always actionable and user-friendly.

* Progress indicators are always visible during swaps.

## Narrative

A crypto enthusiast, frustrated with traditional centralized exchanges, searches for a safer and more autonomous way to swap tokens between chains. Stumbling upon the Atomic Swap interface, they’re immediately greeted with helpful onboarding and a straightforward, trustworthy UI. Connecting their wallet takes seconds; selecting chains and tokens is smooth, with clear-fee transparency and risk warnings highlighted at every stage. When they initiate the swap, real-time progress updates and robust failure recovery options keep them informed and stress-free. Should something go wrong, transparent error messages provide comfort and support, rather than confusion. Thanks to the BMAD-guided development process, every functionality feels stable and responsive, built with fail-safes on every subsystem. As a result, user confidence grows, the business earns trust, and the team iterates confidently, using the BMAD docs for seamless handoffs and agile execution.

## How to Use the BMAD Documents

1. *Business Doc*

  * Read for full project scope, problem framing, user personas, and stakeholder requirements.

  * Use as the north star for prioritization and acceptance criteria.

2. *Model Doc*

  * Study for critical data flows, state transitions, and error-handling requirements.

  * Extract user journeys and system state diagrams for architecture design.

3. *Architecture Doc*

  * Consume for key module boundaries, APIs, dependencies, and design patterns.

  * Break out system into “shards” (modular development tasks) that can be distributed to agents/engineers.

4. *Delivery Doc*

  * Use to track sprint goals, handoff points, blockers, and iteration plans.

  * Log daily status, surface risks, and synchronize cross-role updates.

*Process for AI Agents, Product Managers, Team Leads:*

* Begin with a doc review session, aligning team understanding.

* Create a modular task board based on Architecture and Model Docs.

* Assign “shards” (tasks) to agents/engineers based on skills and dependencies.

* Use Delivery Doc as the single point of sprint reporting and escalation.
