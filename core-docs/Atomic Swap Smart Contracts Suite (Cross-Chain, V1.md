    - Implements withdrawal guarantees including emergency withdrawal logic.

    - Records profit/loss, issues claimable payouts.

    - Restricts critical operations (pause, sweep, upgrade) to admins/multisig.

## User Experience

_Entry Point & First-Time User Experience_

- Users discover the platform via the official dApp, documentation, or CLI guide.

- Onboarding materials guide users through installing a compatible wallet, connecting to approved chains, and depositing funds.

- Users prompted to review/accept key risk disclosures and acknowledge audit status.

- Admin users onboarded via workflow in admin dashboard or CLI with key ceremony/access setup.

_Core Experience_

- _Step 1: Access Platform & Connect Wallet_

  - User navigates to the dApp and connects their wallet on the approved network(s).

  - Clear indicators of wallet/network status; errors prompt corrective guidance.

- _Step 2: Deposit to CapitalPool_

  - User inputs the amount and confirms the deposit; UI presents terms and risk summary.

  - Funds received by contract, deposit receipt issued in UI.

- _Step 3: Strategy Selection & Monitoring_

  - Trader/admin selects strategy or enables “auto-mode” for default strategies.

  - Real-time updates display strategy deployment, execution status, and current pool utilization.

  - Users can opt-in to notifications for events (payout, risk alarm, upgrades).

- _Step 4: Profit Claiming & Withdrawals_

  - Users view accrued profits, with option to claim or withdraw principal/profits.

  - Withdrawal requests batched/fulfilled per contract guarantees, including emergency path.

- _Step 5: Admin Controls & Emergency Actions_

  - Admin dashboard presents risk metrics, allows strategy parameter adjustment or contract pausing.

  - Emergency withdrawal and contract pause are one-click (with explicit warning/signature).

- _Step 6: Audit, Reporting, & Analytics_

  - Users and admins access event/transaction logs, system health, and capital flows dashboards.

  - All platform state changes transparently recorded for review.

_Advanced Features & Edge Cases_

- Power-users can interact via CLI for deployments, monitoring, and withdrawals.

- If an arb attempt fails or relay times out, contract transparently surfaces error, retries if safe, or refunds.

- Emergency withdrawal can be triggered by users if admin inactivity threshold is passed.

- Rate limiting or anti-abuse features for high-frequency interactions.

_UI/UX Highlights_

- Consistent, accessible color scheme for risk/health states.

- Responsive design for desktop/tablet (mobile not in V1).

- Clear, step-by-step confirmations (no hidden risk/consent).

- Prominent display of withdrawal status, audit status, and emergency controls.

- ARIA tags, alt-text on icons, keyboard navigation.

## Narrative

It’s a volatile night in the digital asset markets. Emma, a seasoned quant trader, wants to maximize gains on price discrepancies across Ethereum and Avalanche with minimal operational risk. She logs into Atomic Swap’s dApp, audits the latest security report, and deposits her capital to a cross-chain CapitalPool, confident in its trustless contract guarantees. Meanwhile, Atomic Swap’s admin deploys a new arbitrage strategy via the intuitive dashboard, setting strict limits on capital outlays.

Moments later, the ArbitrageBot receives a relay signal: an opportunity for a high-yield cross-chain trade. The bot executes the strategy—moving funds swiftly and transparently. Emma tracks live PnL and arbitrage execution in real time. Suddenly, a network congestion event disrupts the planned route. The contracts detect timeout, surface the error, and seamlessly reroute, ensuring neither trader nor the pool suffers a loss.

At day’s end, Emma claims her profits in one click, monitors complete audit logs, and, reassured by the ironclad withdrawal guarantee, withdraws her principal at will. With embedded transparency, trustless execution, and rapid response to risk events, the Atomic Swap Smart Contracts Suite delivers not just profit but peace of mind—for users and the business alike.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Core smart contracts: ArbitrageBot, StrategyManager, CapitalPool—all upgradable (with restrictions).

- Establish interfaces/APIs for integration with front-end and off-chain relayers.

- Off-chain relays/oracles for cross-chain execution, with fallback and monitoring.

- Event schemas for rich on-chain logging.

### Integration Points

- Integration with major EVM-compatible chains for cross-chain moves (Ethereum, Avalanche, etc.).

- Oracle partners/relays for strategy triggers (Chainlink, custom relayer).

- Dashboard/UI hooks (webhooks, on-chain event watchers).

- Potential exchange/routing API links for advanced arbitrage.

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All user balances, strategy configs, payouts on-chain.

- Minimal off-chain storage: operational monitoring/logging, with privacy compliance.

- User PII not stored; follows data-at-rest/on-chain privacy best practices.

### Scalability & Performance

- Designed for 10,000+ simultaneous depositors and dozens of strategies.

- Handles multiple arbitrage executions per minute per pool.

- Contracts should support batching of deposits/withdrawals to optimize gas/costs.

### Potential Challenges

- Security: front-running/arbitrage sandwich prevention, oracle manipulation, relay failure.

- Cross-chain latency, relay network downtime.

- Coordination of upgradability with security and immutability demands.

- Emergency and admin access controls—avoiding single points of failure.

- Maintaining user trust through transparent failure and error handling.
